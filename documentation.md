### Project purpose

Our project is a fantasy role-playing (RPG) WoW-like game. ([World of
Warcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft)) You start
the game by creating your character (**hero**). Heroes can carry
**weapons** and **armour**, use different spells (*powers*) and have the
ability to level up by killing monsters. Every hero has multiple unique
characteristics:

-   **Race** (*Human*, *Orc*, *Undead*, *Elf*, *Dwarf*, *Troll*)
-   **Class** (*Warrior*, *Mage*, *Paladin*, *Priest*)

Hero classes differ with one-another. Every class can carry a unique
weapon and has unique spells. The fantasy world in the game consists of
ten *zones* which are inhabited by different monsters. You win the game
by completing all the ten zones!
